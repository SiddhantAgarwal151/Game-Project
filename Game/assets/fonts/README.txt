Place your font files here.

Instructions:
- Copy `arial.ttf` (or any TTF/OTF files you own the rights to) into this folder.
- The game will look for fonts in the following locations (in order):
  1) ../assets/fonts/arial.ttf  (when running from build directory)
  2) assets/fonts/arial.ttf     (alternate relative path)
  3) arial.ttf                  (current working directory)

License note:
- Do NOT commit commercial font binaries into the repository unless you have redistribution rights.
- Prefer using freely-licensed fonts (e.g., Google Fonts) for public projects.
